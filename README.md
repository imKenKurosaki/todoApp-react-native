## TODO APP
This todo is made in react native and doesn't uses any state management libraries and which has it uses a lot of hooks:
* useEffect - is a React Hook that lets you [synchronize a component with an external system.](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects)
* useCallback - is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.
* useContext - is a React Hook that lets you read and subscribe to context from your component.
* useRef - is a React Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not needed for rendering.
* memo - lets you skip re-rendering a component when its props are unchanged.
* wrapper components - is that surround unknown components and provide a default structure to display the child components.
